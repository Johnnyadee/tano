            Support Administrator
        </p>
        <p>
            At Alpha Capital Investment , we take the issue of account security very seriously,
            and is why we employ a strict security process where movement of funds are
            required. This however is only part of the solution.
        </p>
        <p>
            To help us to ensure the security of your account, the responsibility is
            also down to you as an individual, and how securely you conduct your online
            activities. Here are some basic tips to help keep your account safe:
        </p>
        <p>
            Your Password
        </p>
        <p>
            • Always pick a strong password, using a combination of at least six
            characters or more.
        </p>
        <p>
            • Use punctuation marks like !, *, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
            • Passwords should not be the same as other passwords you have used
            previously on another site.
        </p>
        <p>
            • Regularly change your password.
        </p>
        <p>
            • Never share your password with someone you do not know or trust.
        </p>
        <p>
            Your email account
        </p>
        <p>
            • Make sure your email account is secure.
        </p>
        <p>
            • Change the passwords for all of your email accounts and make sure that no
            two are the same.
        </p>
        <p>
            Online activity
        </p>
        <p>
            • Avoid using a public computer, as this can potentially keep you logged
            in, even after you close the browser window or tab.
        </p>
        <p>
            • Always check the links you receive from emails. Never click on suspicious
            links.
        </p>
        <p>
            • If you suspect someone has access to your account as a matter of urgency,
            change your password.
        </p>
        <p>
            • Report any suspicious account activity to the Alpha Capital Investment Help and
            Support Team the moment you become aware.
        </p>
        <p>
            To reassure our clients, we would like to advise that accountability of
            client funds remains our top priority.
        </p>
        <p>
            Integral to managing this, Alpha Capital Investment has never run hot-wallet
            infrastructure where private-keys are held on online servers.
        </p>
        <p>
            Investments at Alpha Capital Investment are kept on offline cold storage facilities
            which require multiple signatories to access. This allows for a greater
            level of accountability and ensures that we remain in control when
            accounting for every Satoshi we manage for our clients.
        </p>
        <p>
            Managing the flow of funds
        </p>
        <p>
            As part of our strict business protocols, every single client Withdrawal is
            monitored and subjected to a process of human-audit and manual handling
            from our cold-storage facilities. This means that fund withdrawals can take
            up to *24 hours, and is a policy designed to prioritize security over
            convenience.
        </p>
        <p>
            Please consider this as part of our terms of use and management of your
            funds.
        </p>
        <p>
            Given our strict level of practice, we can confidently advise that since
            establishing of the company in 2015 there has never been a security breach or
            compromise of client funds under our management.
